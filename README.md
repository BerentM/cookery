# Cookery API
  
## Introduction
This API will be later used in application that will help me keep up with my growing cookbook - it will replace my old school paper notebook.  
Additionally I think that it's great side project to get better grasp on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

## Setup
You require python 3.6+ (preferably 3.10)

Create new virtual environment.
```
python -m venv venv
```
Activate it then install required libraries.
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In the last step start server on localhost.
```
python main.py
```
